The ecat7.0 compatible C library and utilities are available on our anonymous
ftp ftp.topo.ucl.ac.be (Internet adress 130.104.44.3).

Supported plateforms are : digital unix, solaris, sunos 4.1, win32

The software may be modified for your own purposes, but modified
versions may not be distributed without prior consent of the author.

The library is based on ecat 6.x and allow read/write 6.x and 7.0 file format.
Some supplied utilities (show_header, matlist,...) are CTI 6.x utilities that
has been adapted to the new library. The conversion method is described in 
ecat6_to_ecat7.txt.

The include file matrix.h contains C++ function prototyping.

There has been changes in the low lever i/o routines such as 
mat_read_image_subheader.

Ecat 6.4 programs that use generic matrix structures (MatrixFile, MatrixData)
and routines (matrix_open, matrix_close, matrix_read, matrix_write) defined in
the file matrix_extra.c can be linked with this library with minor changes.
We recommend to use the generic function (see matrix.h).

Since Ecat7.0 frame slices are stored in one volumic matrix,
"matrix_read_slice" function has been added read a single slice of
the volume to save time and memory.

Interfile and ANALYZE formats reading are also supported and encapsulated in
the generic matrix structures.
