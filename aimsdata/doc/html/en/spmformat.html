<h1><font color="#c00000">SPM images IO: <font color="#ff0000">***CAUTION***</font>, 
behaviour change in AIMS 3.1</font></h1>

<p><b>Date: 2008/01/05</b></p>

The default settings in AIMS now conform to the SPM2 behaviour, not SPM99 anymore. This affects Aims, Anatomist, Vip and all of our software. User-level options can still override this, of course.<br>
Read the <a href="config.html">config files documentation</a>.<br>
However to avoid problems, it is recommended to avoid the SPM/Analyze format and to use NIFTI-1 instead: NIFTI is the new standard format used by SPM5, FSL and several other software. Unfortunately NIFTI-1 was not supported in AIMS 3.0 and prior versions. 3.1 supports NIFTI-1.

<h3>Image orientation</h3>

As SPM2 changed its image storage conventions regarding neurological / radiological 
images storage compared to SPM99, we had to do something quite similar, but it's kind 
of a mess:
<ul>
  <li>in SPM99:
    <ul>
    <li>images were considered to be in neurological convention (left/right not 
      flipped) unless a default was changed in SPM settings. This flag affected how 
	  images were read.</li>
	<li>Normalized images were always stored in <b>neurological convention</b>, so 
      in labs (like ours) where images were acquired in radio mode, <b>normalized 
	  images were flipped compared to original images</b>.</li>
	<li>Visualization always showed images in their own mode (no flip when viewing 
	  them).</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
  <li>in SPM2:
	<ul>
	<li>images are still considered to be in neurological convention unless a setting 
	  is changed in SPM</li>
	  <li>Normalized images are now stored in their <b>original convention</b>, ie 
	  following the setting, so <b><em>radiological images normalized with SPM99 
	  and the same images normalized withg SPM2 are not written in the same 
	  direction</em></b>. The setting is taken into account for calculations (ie 
	  internally flipping the normalization template or something like this).
	</li>
	<li>Visualization now always shows images in <b>neurological convention</b>, 
	  <em>not</em> what it did before.
	</li>
	<li>As far as we know, there is <b><em>no way to know how an image has been 
	  written</em></b>, this means we can't guess if it was normalized with SPM99 or 
	  with SPM2, and so we <em>don't know</em> if a normalized image made from a 
	  radiological raw image is in neuro or radio convention.
	</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
</ul>
   
We can't automatically know when reading an image, so <em>YOU</em> have to tell what 
happened to your images (see below).<br>
In AIMS/Anatomist, it' another mess:
<ul>
  <li>in 2.2.x packages and earlier (AIMS 2.12, anatomist 1.29, VIP 2.4):
  <ul>
    <li>Non-normalized images were <b>always</b> considered to be in <b>radiological</b>
	  convention (left/right flipped) because, er... just because it's the way 
	  <em>we</em> use them in our lab...
    </li>
    <li>Normalized images were always considered in <b>neurological</b> mode as 
	  SPM99 wrote them.
    </li>
    <li>Visualization always showed images in <b>radiological convention</b></li>
    <li>There was (and is still) no clean way to guess if an image is normalized 
	  or not. The only thing we can do is compare the image field of view to those of 
	  standard normalization templates used in SPM (like the MNI template), which 
	  hopefully have so funny dimensions that we can more or less reliably recognize 
	  them. But using a custom template, or using an non-normalized image with the 
	  same dimensions as the template, can abuse our detection.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>in 2.3.x packages and later (AIMS 2.13, anatomist 1.30):<br>
	We can't guess everything, so we now use settings, like SPM does. Like in 
	SPM, a settings configuration is <b>not able to read correctly every image</b>. 
	You will have to change Aims settings when switching between SPM99 and SPM2 images. 
	There is a "site-wide" settings file (located in <tt>$AIMS_PATH/shared/aimsrc</tt> 
	or <tt>$SHFJ_SHARED_PATH/aims/aimsrc</tt>), and a "personal" settings file, located 
	if <tt>$HOME/.aimsrc</tt>. See the <a href="config.html">configuration file 
	documentation</a> for more details.<br>
	For SPM files, the following parameters can change the behaviour of reading/writing
	SPM files by Aims:
	<ul>
	  <li><tt>spm_input_radio_convention</tt></li>
	  <li><tt>spm_input_spm2_normalization</tt></li>
	  <li><tt>spm_output_radio_convention</tt></li>
	  <li><tt>spm_output_spm2_normalization</tt></li>
	  <li><tt>spm_force_output_convention</tt></li>
	</ul>
	All these parameters are described in the <a href="config.html">config file 
	documentation</a>.<br>
	Tags are set in <tt>.minf</tt> files saved with images in SPM format by 
	Aims/Anatomist, so the next time we read them, we know how to read them.<br>
	These tags are:
	<ul>
	  <li><tt>spm_radio_convention</tt></li>
	  <li><tt>spm_spm2_normalization</tt></li>
	</ul>
	and are the equivalents of the above input/output flags of the settings.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
	
<p><b>Be careful, any mistake in these options can result in flipped images with 
left and right switched.</b> This is not always visible at the first sight and can 
mess a whole study if you don't pay attention to that.</p>
  
<p><b><font color="#ff0000">Warning:</font> VIP library and commands have not 
changed, they are still in "SPM99/radiological" mode</b>.</p>

<a name="volume4d"></a>
<h3>4D volumes</h3>

<p>SPM99 could not read 4D Analyze/SPM images. It used to read/write series of 3D
volumes, so a 4D volume had to be split. SPM2 now supports 4D volumes.</p>

<p>AIMS 2.12 and earlier versions followed SPM rule when writing 4D volumes: they 
were split into a series of 3D volumes. Aims 2.13 is able to write 4D volumes 
that can be read by SPM2. The behaviour of AIMS is determined by an option in 
the <a href="config.html">settings file</a>: <tt>spm_output_4d_volumes</tt>. 
This variable is 1 if not specified (4D enabled), but is disabled by default 
in the global config file going with the AIMS 2.13 distribution so as to 
keep complete compatibility with SPM99.</p>

<p>4D Volumes saved as 3D series can now be read as a 4D volume if:
<li>they were saved by AIMS 2.13 or later</li>
<li>the first volume of the series is given as input to Aims or Anatomist</li>
Aims 2.13 saves indications about the series (timesteps number, files in the 
series) in the <tt>.minf</tt> header of the first 3D volume.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> AIMS 2.12 and earlier had a bug and did not write correctly 4D 
volumes as a series, the <tt>.minf</tt> meta-header should be removed from 
those volumes, and they cannot be re-read as a 4D volume (unless the 
<tt>.minf</tt> is manually fixed).</p>
