<b>Date: 2009/08/26</b><br>

<p>In <b>AIMS version 2.13</b> and later, AIMS uses a settings file, currently used 
to specify SPM IO conventions, and possibly other things in the future. There is one 
site-wide settings file (in the shared directory of Aims: 
<tt>$AIMS_PATH/shared/aimsrc</tt> or <tt>$SHFJ_SHARED_PATH/aims/aimsrc</tt>) and one 
personal <tt>$HOME/.aimsrc</tt> file. Personal settings override site-wide settings. 
Both files are in the same format: python format 
at the moment, until we have XML IO. Example:
</p>
<pre>
attributes = {
  '__syntax__' : 'aims_settings', 
  'spm_input_radio_convention' : 1, 
  'spm_input_spm2_normalization' : 0, 
  'spm_output_radio_convention' : 1, 
  'spm_output_spm2_normalization' : 0, 
  'spm_output_4d_volumes' : 0, 
}</pre>

<p>By the way, these specific settings correspond to the behaviour of SPM99. They used to be the site-wide defaults in AIMS 3.0 and earlier.<br>
In AIMS 3.1, the defaults correspond to SPM2: all <tt>spm_*</tt> options set to <tt>1</tt>.
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> these defaults are different from the defaults used by the library if 
no settings are provided: with no settings provided, AIMS will act like 
<em>SPM2</em> does, because it's the future behaviour. Nevertheless many people are 
still using <em>SPM99</em>, and for smooth compatibility with previous 
versions of AIMS and Anatomist, we heve decided not to adopt this default right now. 
When <em>SPM99</em> has disapeared, we may change the defaults.</p>

<p>Don't change the two first lines: <tt>attributes&nbsp;=&nbsp;{</tt> is the 
identifier of the python-like format for the config file, and 
<tt>'__syntax__'&nbsp;:&nbsp;'aims_settings',</tt> identifies the file type to be AIMS 
configuration file. The other attributes can change, be modified, removed, or added.</p>

<p>The set of currently known attributes (in AIMS 2.13) is:</p>

  <td>Hints about the IO format to use when writing an object with no information about it (no extension, no specified format). The value of this attribute is a dictionary. Each entry key is an object type name, either completely specified ( <tt>'volume of S16'</tt>), or a general object type name (<tt>'Volume'</tt>). The corresponding value is the format name (<tt>'NIFTI1'</tt>, <tt>'GIS'</tt> etc.).

  <td>Determines how to understand the unspecified orientation of SPM images read by 
    AIMS. "Unspecified orientation" means no indication in the <tt>.minf</tt> file 
	written by AIMS or Anatomist with the image. This flag is quite equivalent to the 
	SPM flag. <tt>0</tt> means <em>neurological</em> convention, and <tt>1</tt> means 
	<em>radiological</em> convention (left and right are flipped). Note that this flag 
	is not supposed to tell Anatomist how to display the image, but how to <em>read</em> 
	it: if read in the correct orientation, Anatomist should always display images in 
	<em>radiological</em> convention by default (unless a <em>display-only</em> flag is 
	set in Anatomist). This flag actually affects processings, but Anatomist flag does 
	<em>not</em>.<br>
	When AIMS (or Anatomist) writes an image in SPM format, its orientation convention 
	is written with it in the <tt>.minf</tt> file going with it.<br>

	format ambiguity.

	<em>SPM99</em> always wrote normalized images in <em>neurological</em> 
	convention, regardless of the input convention.<br>
	<em>SPM2</em> writes norlalized images in the orientation specified for reading, ie 
	if images are specified to be in <em>radiological</em> convention before 
	normalization, the normalized images made from them will be saved in 
	<em>radiological</em> orientation.<br>
