mincheader.h
------------

DONE 1) Change the file Id
DONE 2) Constructor : are the parameters other than name useful ?

mincheader.cc
-------------
DONE 1) Change functions "inHelper" and "inVecHelper".
DONE 2) What is the difference between "MIxspace" and "xspace" ?
DONE 3) Add 4D volume support
DONE 4) What to do with byte order ?
DONE 5) What to do with open mode ?
DONE 6) How to read the rest of the minc header and store it into a file (.minf I guess) ?
DONE 7) Make MINC silent

MincR.h
-------
1) Should we keep the operator ">>" ?
DONE 2) Add support for 4D volumes.

MincW.h
-------
DONE 1) How to put back the complete Minc header correctly ? (should be useful for voxel to world transforms)
DONE 2) Add support for 4D volumes.

mincformat.cc
-------------
1) The program is not able to find the minc file if the extension is not given


ALL FILES
---------
Warning : memory allocations/dealloc

Attributes
----------
DONE - patient id vs. patient name
DONE - start_time : string vs vector<int>
DONE - history : string vs vector<string>
- What to do with variable values (not attribute values !) ?
- Should we handle the Minc variable "processing" in addition to history ?
- What to do with spi_XXX and dicom_XXX ?
- Look at other image types to see if there are additional attributes

- DO MORE EXAMPLES
	- MRI : DONE
	- Label : DONE
	- Float : DONE
	- fMRI : ??
	- DTI : ??
	- DTI/RGB : ??
	- PET : ??
	- CT : ?
	- SPECT : ?
	
- Make it possible to write in "voxel value" mode.
