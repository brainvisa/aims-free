/*

This library provides an interface to both compressed (gzip/zlib) and
uncompressed (normal) file IO.  The functions are written to have the
same interface as the standard file IO functions.  

To use this library instead of normal file IO, the following changes
are required:
 - replace all instances of FILE* with znzFile
 - change the name of all function calls, replacing the initial character
   f with the znz  (e.g. fseek becomes znzseek)
 - add a third parameter to all calls to znzopen (previously fopen)
   that specifies whether to use compression (1) or not (0)
 - use znz_isnull rather than any (pointer == NULL) comparisons in the code
 
NB: seeks for writable files with compression are quite restricted
